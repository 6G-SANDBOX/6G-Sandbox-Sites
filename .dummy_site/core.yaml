# SITE: SAMPLE_SITE

# Your site should have a list of ports ready to forward traffic to the tn_bastion of the Trial Networks.
# The correlation between the endpoint ports and the tn_bastions is done by the ending digits of their IP address in the default networks. Dots are ignored
# E.g. Ports range: 39841-39898 (site_ports_digits=5, site_ports_prefix=398), IP addresses range should end in 41-98, e.g. IPs 10.24.0.141-10.24.0.198
# E.g. Ports range: 9615-9667 (site_ports_digits=4, site_ports_prefix=96), IP addresses range should end in 15-97, e.g. IPs 10.24.0.15-10.24.0.67
site_public_ip: "12.34.56.78"    # Public endpoint for VPN connections to the tn_bastion.
site_ports_digits: 5             # Digits of the ports to be exposed. All ports need to have the same number of digits (generally 4 or 5)
site_ports_prefix: 398           # Common digits of the ports to be exposed. "site_ports_digits - site_ports_prefix.length" is the number of digits deduced from tn_bastion's default IP
site_domain: "6gsandbox.mysite.internal"   # DNS domain each Trial Network will be part of. Each tn_bastion will be the authoritative DNS of a subdomain inside this domain (e.g. mytrialnetwork.6gsandbox.mysite.internal)
site_dns: "10.11.28.107"                   # Optional comma-separated list of DNS Servers used by the tn_bastion to resolve all name resolution queries. If unspecified, "8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1" will be used.

# Each key of the dictionary indicates that a component is present in this site.
# Each component may (or may not) require unique site-specific configuration such as its OpenNebula VM template and VM image IDs.
# The list of fields which must be filled to enable a component in each site, is documented in file .tnlcm/public.yaml of the component in the 6G-Library repository.
# Any site needs to at least have tn_init, tn_bastion and tn_vxlan.
